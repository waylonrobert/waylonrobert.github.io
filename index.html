I'm a digital problem solver and user-centered design advocate based in Southern California.</p>

  <p>I currently design, develop, and manage digital products as Senior Web Services Manager for <a href="http://www.calbaptist.edu">California Baptist University</a> where I lead a small team of developers and content specialists. I also teach courses on various information technology topics ranging from web development to project management. And if that wasn't enough, I volunteer as a Director and Interim-Treasurer on the <a href="http://highedweb.org">Higher Education Web Professionals Association</a> Board of Directors.</p>

<p>My current professional interests lie with user-centered design and its underlying psychology including but not limited to UX design, HCI, and IA design.</p>

<p>I'm passionate about the web and the technologies used to build it. I'm also keenly interested in how we use digital products to improve the way we live.</p>

<p>I've worked with some great companies doing design, development, and consulting work:</p>

<ul>

  <h3>California Baptist University Project Request System</h3><img src="/images/cbu-marketing-projectrequests-min.png" /><p>With an enrollment of just under 10,000 students, and over 1,000 employees, CBU’s marketing unit is tasked with providing the university with professional marketing services across print, digital, and advertising verticals. The system currently in use was very rigid, not user friendly, and required contacting with an outside software developer whenever maintenance or improvements were needed. </p><p>As the lead designer and manager for this project, I conducted user research including a group brainstorming session and individual user interviews that enabled me to identify the unique needs of the marketing unit. A pattern quickly emerged from this research: too many projects were being requested with unreasonable due dates, the previous system’s categorization method was not effective, and clients found it very difficult to request projects.</p><p>Armed with this research, I sketched some preliminary wireframes to identify functionality. Then, I added some more detail, but chose to be conservative both in use of color and hierarchy as it was important to not clutter the interface for two reasons: 1) the end user needed to be able to request projects with ease; and 2) the marketing staff needed to be able to review and process requests quickly so they could focus on what really mattered (creating excellent products to market the university). </p><p>The end result saw delivery of a project management system tailored to the marketing unit’s needs, placing the user first.<br></p><p><strong>Responsibilities:</strong> <em>Product design; Project management; User research, experience design, and testing; User-interface design; Front-end development</em>

  <h3>California Baptist University Website</h3><img src="/images/cbu-site-2016-ea123ed0.png" /><p>As Senior Web Services Manager at California Baptist University (CBU), I worked with a team of designers, developers, and marketers to redesign and implement a website that would make content easier to find for future students and improve page performance (particularly important for international recruitment).</p><p>The team started from scratch with an extensive discovery phase. In this phase, the team conducted multiple user interviews of CBU constituents in an effort to understand <em>how</em> CBU's website was being used. From there, the team was able to identify patterns and discover challenges to our assumptions.</p><p>Using a mobile-first approach, the team designed and developed a website that responded to what we learned in the discovery phase. </p><p>We also conducted a round of user tests to hone our final design.</p><p>Launched in September 2016, the <a href="https://calbaptist.edu" title="California Baptist University">CBU website</a> is the culmination of hard work, passion, and dedication.<br></p><p><strong>Responsibilities:</strong> <em>Project management; User research, experience design, and testing; User-interface design; Front-end development</em>

<h3>Southern California Public Radio Website</h3><img src="/images/scpr-site-2011-93a20b5d.png" /><p>Launched in January 2012, KPCC 89.3 Southern California Public Radio's website redesign was designed to be more engaging to current listeners and more attractive to new listeners.</p><p>Working in a freelance capacity alongside SCPR's UX team, I was tasked with developing front-end templates and patterns in support of the redesign, including the homepage.</p><p><strong>Responsibilities:</strong> <em>Front-end development</em></p></article><article class="contact"><h2>Contact Me</h2><p>Want to contact me?
